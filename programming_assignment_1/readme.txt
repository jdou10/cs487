1. So for the first step I set up a TRAIN_URL to read the dataset from iris.csv
the column_names indicate different title of each column

2. On line 29, I use iris.shape function to generate the data from dataset, and
print out the rows and columns use print function

3. On line 31, I use .unique function to print out the different classification
of the last column which they are"Iris-setosa" "Iris-versicolor" and "Iris-virg
inica"

4. On line 33, use the funtion .shape[0] to generate the total rows of iris-set
osa. 

the code running fine for first four question but I can not solve the question 5.
