# CS519/487(Spring) Project
# DDoS attack Detection techniques
# Name: Shengping Bi, Jingru Dou, Yuxi Wang
# Date: 03/13/2022
# Purpose: This Project is for detecting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Cyberattacks efficiently
#           using (AI) and ML algorithms.

Filename:
	groupwork.py	groupwork_2.py

Python version: 
	Python 3.7

Required modules: 
	numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib

Instructions:
	Since the entire data was too large, we chose to split it into subsets for data analysis.

	Dataset: DDoS 2019 
	File Name: CSV-03-11.zip 
	File Size: 876M
	(https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ddos-2019.html)

	After unzipping the files, place a total of 7 csv files in the same path as the program. 
	Run groupwork.py to get 7 subsets.

	Run groupwork_2.py to train the models and test the prediction accuracy.


(iii) data set information: 
In our project, we use an existing dataset to test the solutions with benign DDoS attacks. The dataset is from CIC (Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity) webpage. link in here: https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ddos-2019.html. The dataset is DDoS Evaluation Dataset(CIC-DDoS2019).
