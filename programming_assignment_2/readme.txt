to run the program: 

For Iris-dataset:
on line 134, in the main function, 
change the classifier to 'perceptron' 'adaline' or 'sgd' to test each classifier.

For Abalone dataset:
uncomment line 133 and comment out line 132, which the datafile indicate'abalone.csv'
then is the same thing of change classifier name like the above.

ps: I think the code still have minor error since is not working in 'adaline'
and 'sgd' classifier, because is running the same result as perceptron does and
I don't know how to fix it.
